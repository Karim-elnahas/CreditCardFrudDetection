Steps to execute the program:

Note: The path input code has been designed for Windows OS.

For Windows Operating System-->
1. After running the code it will ask for the path of the dataset (absolute path), provide it and press enter. It has provision to read both excel or csv. 
   Path Example: C:\Users\ayushk\Desktop\creditcard.csv 
   Note: If running on Linux, kindly make sure to provide the path in this format only.

2. The program will execute all the algorithms one by one. If you want to skip a particular one, you can comment that section
   of the code.

3. Nothing else needs to be done then, it will take some time to execute (since the dataset is very big). The DEBUG, INFO and 
   RESULT statements will help you keep track of the execution.
